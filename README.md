Assignment 1 -- Binit Shrestha

In this assignment, I created a website using only
HTML and CSS. I seperated all the content with the
styling to follow conventions. I checked all errors
from HTML and CSS validators and made sure this
website is correctly coded. I believe I implemented
everything I wanted correctly.

I spent around 1 hour in this assignment with the
help from no one.
